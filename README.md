# Test

## Description

The test will be to create a localized webapp which displays a list of emojis to the user, with their image and name. Users will be able to favourite emojis, search for them, and switch between arabic and english. Everything should persist through reloads.

The stack can be whatever you like, but you must have a backend server which serves the translations and emojis to the client. Any data transformation may take place on the client though.

The emojis can be found attached in `emoji.csv`.

You must also provide a way for us to run your completed code.

## Evaluation

What I'll be looking for is mainly how you work and commit, so frequent commits, and organized code are important. I'll also be looking at the UI and UX but to a lesser degree.
